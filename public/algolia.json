Other fancy features of upstream projects are not supported by this Hugo theme, I\u0026rsquo;d like to make it as simple as possible and only focus on blog purpose, at least for now.\nWhile I created this theme, I followed the Hugo theme best practice and tried to make every part of the template as a replaceable partial html, so it could be much easier for you to make your customization based on it.\u003c/p\u003e","tags":null,"title":"Clean White Theme for Hugo","type":"post","url":"/post/readme/","weight":0,"wordcount":953},{"author":null,"categories":null,"content":null,"date":-62135596800,"description":"","dir":"about\\","excerpt_html":null,"excerpt_text":null,"expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":600,"html":null,"keywords":null,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"8576ec274c98b3831668a172fa632d80","permalink":"http://localhost:4321/about/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","readingtime":1,"relpermalink":"/about/","section":"","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"about-me\"\u003eAbout Me\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eHuabing Zhao\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e is a software architect, an Istio Member and an ONAP PTL.
